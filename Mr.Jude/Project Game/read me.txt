A very simple game of breakout:
Has a pause button (esc), q in pause is quit
Ball start in middle with paddle, space to release (move paddle left to shoot ball left, right is default)
Clearing all blocks recreates all blocks
When balls hits block it breaks it and gives 100 points (increases by 100 after each full clear)
Paddle and ball increase speed by 0.1 each full clear
Space in game over to restart
